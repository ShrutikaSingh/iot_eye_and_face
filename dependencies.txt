Change directory to server's root, or wherever you want to place your workspace

cd ~

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

First, let's make ourselves a nice workspace directory:

mkdir opencv_workspace

cd opencv_workspace

Now that we're in here, let's grab OpenCV:

sudo apt-get install git

git clone https://github.com/Itseez/opencv.git

We've cloned the latest version of OpenCV here. Now let's get some essentials:

Compiler: sudo apt-get install build-essential

Libraries: sudo apt-get install cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev

Python bindings and such: sudo apt-get install python-dev python-numpy libtbb2 libtbb-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libjasper-dev libdc1394-22-dev



Finally, let's grab the OpenCV development library:

sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
